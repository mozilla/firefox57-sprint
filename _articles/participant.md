Thanks for your interest in attending an event!

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-default btn-next btn-xs-full" href="{{ '/register/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Find a local event in your area&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

### Steps on how to sign up for a local event

* Go to the <a href="{{ '/register/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Registration</a> page and look for an event in your area
* Click on the event you are interested in and you will be redirected to the signup page for that event
* If there is no event in your area, consider <a href="{{ '/host/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">hosting</a> one yourself :)
