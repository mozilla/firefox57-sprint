### How to host an event

So you decided to host an event, congratulations! Your efforts will help Firefox to have a successful launch in your region. You haven’t organized an event before? Don’t worry, you can find everything on how to organize an event on this event guide.

### Workflow

* Introduction talk, why this work is important for Firefox in your region
* Participants install [Firefox Beta](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta) for Desktop
* Check the [Alexa list](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries) of the most famous websites in your local area and choose the website you want to test. Please don't start at the top to make sure we do not only test the top 10.
* Once you have finished testing a website go and [report it on the report form]({{ '/reporting/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), you will find all the info you need on how to report your work
* Keep doing the awesome work and make Firefox better!
* At the end of the event, the nickname with the most tested sites will get a t-shirt

### Resources you can request

**Swag for your event:**
